I write and reflect about what I learned at work and college.
My chaotic adventures relate mainly to Ruby on Rails, how to write better OOP Code, and optimize Workflow.
My hobby Projects usually are about workflow, helpful litle scripts or neovim related.

I'm a passionate nvim user and try my best to live my life in the Terminal.
